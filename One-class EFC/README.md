# Experiments

To reproduce the experiments, first download ([CICIDS17](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html),
[CICDDoS19](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html),
[CIDDS-001](https://www.hs-coburg.de/forschung/forschungsprojekte-oeffentlich/informationstechnologie/cidds-coburg-intrusion-detection-data-sets.html)) and extract the data set in its corresponding directory.


Then execute **exec_all.py**. This file executes the scripts for preprocessing the data set, separating train/test sets, conducting training/test and collecting results.

After execution, the results will be in the Data/Results directory.
